# ToDo List App in React

Welcome to the **ToDo List App** project! This React-based application is designed to help users efficiently manage their daily tasks with a simple and intuitive interface. The app allows users to add, update, and remove tasks, all while keeping track of the number of completed and total tasks.

## Project Overview

The ToDo List App provides a sleek, responsive, and interactive experience, allowing users to easily manage tasks. It uses React's state management to dynamically handle user input and render tasks, keeping the user updated on the number of completed and pending tasks.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can quickly add tasks using the input field. Each task appears below the input box.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list when no longer needed or are completed.
- **Task Completion**: Users can mark tasks as completed, which updates the task counter in real-time.
- **Live Task Statistics**: The app displays live statistics, including the total number of tasks and completed tasks.

## User Interface

- **Input Field**: A text input at the center allows the user to type and add new tasks.
- **Task List**: Added tasks appear in a list format with options to remove them once completed.
- **Task Counters**: At the bottom of the interface, counters are showing the number of completed tasks and the total number of tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Builds the core functionality and interface of the application, utilizing React hooks for managing state.
- **CSS**: Provides a clean and modern design for the application, with responsive styles.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic behind adding, updating, and deleting tasks dynamically.
