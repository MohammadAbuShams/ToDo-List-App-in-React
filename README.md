# ToDo List App in React

Welcome to the **ToDo List App** project! This React-based application is designed to help users efficiently manage their daily tasks with a simple and intuitive interface. The app allows users to add, update, and remove tasks, all while keeping track of the number of completed and total tasks.

## Project Overview

- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list when no longer needed or are completed.
- **Task Completion**: Users can mark tasks as completed, which updates the task counter in real-time.
- **Live Task Statistics**: The app displays live statistics, including the total number of tasks and completed tasks.

## User Interface

- **Input Field**: A text input at the center allows the user to type and add new tasks.
- **Task List**: Added tasks appear in a list format with options to remove them once completed.
- **Task Counters**: At the bottom of the interface, counters are showing the number of completed tasks and the total number of tasks.

## Technologies Used
